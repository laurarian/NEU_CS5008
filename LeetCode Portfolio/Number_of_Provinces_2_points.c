/**
 * Using DFS to count provinces in a graph represented by an adjacency matrix:
 * - Maintain a 'visited' array to keep track of explored cities.
 * - Initiate a DFS for each unvisited city:
 *   1. Mark as visited.
 *   2. Recursively visit all directly connected cities.
 *   3. Each DFS initiation from an unvisited city marks a new province.
 * Complexity:
 * - Time: O(n^2), due to potential DFS across all entries in the n x n matrix.
 * - Space: O(n), needed for the visited tracker and recursion stack depth.
