/** DFS(preorder traversal): root,left,right
 * We use the following steps following preorder traversal:
 * 1. Shift the Left Subtree: Transform the left subtree of each node into the right subtree.
 * 2. Attach the Right Subtree: Connect the original right subtree to the farthest right node of the new right subtree.
 * 3. Iterate: Continue this method for each node, moving from one to the next, until no nodes remain.
 * since the order is the same with the preorder traversal,so it can be successful.
 * 
 * Complexity:
 * - Time: O(n), as each node in the tree is visited just once and only simple operations are performed on each.
 * - Space: O(1), since we're altering the tree directly without using extra space.
