# Lab 2 -- Linked Lists

This is the starting readme for this assignment.  Please edit the following 
information by removing the "*edit me*" and replace it with appropriate 
information your assignment. If it is asking you a question, please provide 
a response.

- Name: Rong Huang
- Title: Lab02 
- How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? 2 hour
- Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell 
  us who and in what capacity.
  - Now I completed it by myself.But I watched the moduel3 videos and some YouTube videos to get the knowledge.
- Did you use any external resources? (Cite them below)

  - Introduction to Linked List:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9PTBwOzceo
- (Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - I found the most engaging part to be observing how pointers link individual nodes into a linked list and access their data. Writing this in C, as opposed to a high-level language like Python, allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of computers and memory management.
- (Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
  - I suggest enhancing the node and list creation process by utilizing loops, which could improve the efficiency of creating the linked list. This approach not only makes the code more maintainable and scalable but also adapts well to changes in the data structure or volume.

## Logistics

For this assignment (and every assignment/lab), you must login into the 
servers through `your_khoury_name@login.khoury.northeastern.edu` to complete 
and test your work. The reason is the examples I will provide below are 
compiled strictly for our machine's architecture, and this is a consistent 
architecture where your submission will be graded.

### Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. 
  Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we 
  grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files (if any) into your repository so we 
  can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo, make sure 
  that you **submit them to GitHub before the assignment deadline!**
